<h1>BEST FOODS FOR PCOS</h1>
	<p>Protein: Inflammation may be reduced and the chances of ovulation may be increased by trying to replace animal fats with fish or vegetable sources. Salmon contains protein and omega-3 fatty acids.<br>
		
Folic Acid and B12: Women with higher levels of these micronutrients have higher rates of live birth after IVF. Folic acid is known to prevent neural tube (spinal cord) defects in babies and is routinely recommended when trying to conceive. Folic acid (400mcg-1mg) is a routine ingredient in prenatal vitamins. Green leafy vegetables (spinach, bok choy, parsley, romaine lettuce) are good sources of dietary folate. B12 can be found in eggs, cheese and milk products.<br></p>
